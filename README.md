# Ken Burns

Ken Burns is an extension for Adobe Premiere Pro that automatically applies a constant scale effect to the clip(s) selected in the timeline.

This extension is tested and optimized for macOS and Adobe Premiere Pro version 2022 or later. Functionality on other operating systems or older versions of Premiere is not guaranteed.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

First, [download the zip folder from this link](https://github.com/JSP-Premiere-Pro-Panel-Extensions/jsp.kenBurns/files/10440972/jsp.kenBurns.zip). Then, unzip the file on your computer. 

You should now have a folder named `jsp.kenBurns`. 
Move or copy this folder into the appropriate location depending on your operating system.

If you're using macOS: `Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`

If you're using Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions`

NOTE: functionality in Windows is not guaranteed.
    
Once you've placed the folder in the appropriate location, launch Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 or later. 
If the application is already running, close and relaunch it.

Access the panel extension by navigating through the Premiere menu at the top of the screen:
   
    Window -> Extensions -> Ken Burns
    
## Applying grow or shrink <a name="applying"></a>

Click on the button that corresponds to the type of scaling effect you'd like to apply.

A menu will open with a few customizable parameters.

When the `Apply` button is clicked, the extension will modify the Motion/Scale property of the selected clip(s) according to the parameters indicated by the user.

The `Rate` parameter determines the constant speed of the scaling effect in percents per second.

The `Initial scale` parameter determines the starting value of the scale effect as a percent.

The `Final scale` parameter determines the ending value of the scale effect as a percent.

The extension will try to accomodate the parameters according to the selected checkboxes. 
If you'd like a parameter to be used in the creation of the scale effect, check the corresponding checkbox. 
If you'd like to ignore a parameter, uncheck.
Parameters without a specified value are automatically ignored.

- If all three parameters are checked, rate is ignored. 
- If only rate is checked, an initial or final scale of 100% is assumed, depending on whether the user has requested a grow or shrink. 
- If only initial or final scale is checked, a rate of 0 is assumed. 
- If no parameters are checked, the scale effect defaults to a constant 100%.

In most cases, keyframes will be placed on the first and last frames of the clip. 
However, if the maximum (10000%) or minimum (0%) scales are reached, a keyframe will be placed mid-clip.

Negative rates are allowed, but negative scale values will not work.

NOTE: upon applying a grow or shrink, the extension will remove and replace any existing keyframes or value for the Motion/Scale property.

NOTE: if no clips are selected in the timeline, the extension will not do anything.

## Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

### No keyframe interpolation

There is no way to create non-linear keyframes (such as ease in or ease out) using this extension.

### Removes existing keyframes

The extension removes any existing keyframes associated with the clip's Motion/Scale property when a grow or shrink is applied. 
This includes a scale value generated by the `Set to Frame Size` function.

### No undo functionality

Sacle effects generated using the panel extension cannot be removed using the traditional undo function.

### No automatic update

If the clip is resized in the timeline, or otherwise adjusted, the keyframes are not automatically updated. 
The grow or shrink must be re-applied to recreate the scale effect.

### No perspective compensation 

*(feature removed in v1.0)*

Although two clips may scale at the same constant rate, perspective may cause their motion to apparently differ. 
For example, over the same amount of time, a scale from 100-105% will always appear "faster" than a scale from 200-205%.

In order to compensate for perspective, the rate of a scale effect should increase as a clip grows and decrease as it shrinks. 
This feature is not included in the extension.
